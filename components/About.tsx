            I'm Aryan Anand, a final-year Computer Science Engineering student who loves building for the web and exploring how AI can make things simpler, faster, and more enjoyable. I learn best by creating, experimenting, and refining ideas until they feel right.

            I focus on modern web development, automation, and applied machine learning. I enjoy working across the stack—designing clean interfaces, writing scalable backend logic, and building systems that feel smooth, practical, and easy to use.

            Right now, I'm finishing my final year of CSE and focusing on sharpening my skills, exploring new tools, and growing as an engineer. I enjoy solving problems, improving my craft, and forming a mindset that balances good engineering with thoughtful product thinking.
